Goal: statistical profiling of commonly-available personal information.
For example, a given first name may suggest gender, age and cultural information
such as ethnicity and religion. These suggestions then suggest yet more things
such as education level, interests, BMI, height, etc.

We can't possibly know everything about someone from a name and an IP address,
but this sort of information *can* give us a starting point for subtle
customization of someone's online experience which can ultimately result in a
happier customer.

We'll construct a database using accurate publicly-available census, genealogical 
and other data and and then cross-reference an incomplete set of information and
return a set of statistical speculations.

Requirements: python3, sqlite3, unzip
	apt-get install sqlite3 unzip python python3
